  "summary": "REQ-26 and REQ-28 appear implemented via a reusable frontend error-state component (with raw/copyable error details and Retry) plus authorization-aware error parsing that explicitly instructs admins to use the `caffeineAdminToken` parameter. REQ-27 (backend hardening for empty `caffeineAdminToken` during access-control initialization) is not evidenced in the provided backend diff snippet, so it cannot be verified as implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Ensure backend access-control initialization does not trap/break authenticated usage when `caffeineAdminToken` is missing/empty; calling initialization with empty string must succeed and normal authenticated flows must continue to work; valid token behavior unchanged.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows many backend authorization checks and state initialization, but does not show any change to the access-control initialization entrypoint/logic that handles an empty admin token (nor any guarding against traps on empty input). With the backend file truncated, there is insufficient evidence that the empty-secret path was hardened.",

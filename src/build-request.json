      "text": "When an admin session is active, treat the admin as being on the “Full Package” plan for all user-facing plan displays and plan-derived UI state (e.g., the dashboard “Current Plan” card), so the admin never appears to be operating under the Free plan.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "With an active admin session, the User Dashboard “Current Plan” value displays “Full Package” (or clearly indicates Full Package via admin context) even if the stored profile plan is Free.",
        "With an active admin session, any plan-derived labels/badges that reflect the user’s tier use an effective plan equivalent to Full Package, avoiding any visible “Free plan” labeling for admins.",
        "This change does not modify the stored plan tier in the user profile; ending the admin session returns the UI to showing the actual saved plan tier for that principal."
